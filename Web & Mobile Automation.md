## 🚀 Our Automation Expertise

We specialize in automation that delivers high velocity, accuracy, and confidence in every deployment:

### ✅ Web Automation

- 🌐 Robust UI test automation using **Cypress**, **Selenium**, and **Playwright**, tailored for modern single-page apps (SPAs) and enterprise web platforms.
- 📝 Automates critical user journeys including **form submissions**, **tabular data handling**, **file upload/download**, and **interactive elements** like modals and dropdowns.
- 📊 Implements **data-driven testing** with fixtures and custom commands, and supports **visual regression** via screenshot diffing for pixel-perfect interfaces.
- 🌎 Validated across multiple browsers and screen sizes for **cross-browser** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and **responsive UI behavior** using Cypress Viewport & Playwright Device Emulation.
- 🔁 Integrated directly with CI/CD pipelines for automated test runs on every PR, commit, or deployment, with alerts on failures via **Slack** or **email**.


### 📱 Mobile Automation

- 🤖 End-to-end test automation for **native**, **hybrid**, and **mobile web apps** using **Appium**, enabling seamless cross-platform testing on Android and iOS.
- 🎯 Automates complex scenarios including gestures (swipe, tap, scroll), OS version handling, **deep linking**, hardware simulations (camera, GPS), and **biometric auth**.
- ☁️ Integrated with **BrowserStack** and **LambdaTest** for real device testing, including video capture, logs, and instant feedback across multiple devices and OS versions.
- 🧩 Built on a modular Page Object framework (TestNG/WebDriverIO), enabling **scalable, maintainable** test suites with rich reporting via **Allure** and **Mochawesome**.
- 🚀 Fully integrated with CI/CD pipelines (**GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**) to enable automated regression runs on pull requests, merges, or nightly builds.
